- **Smart Persistence:** Automatically saves progress to `LocalStorage`, preventing data loss during page refreshes.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Fully localized for **English**, **Portuguese (PT)**, and **Spanish (ES)**.
- **Responsive UX:** Features a smart header with global controls, an image carousel, and dynamic result visualizations.
